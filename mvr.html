                    <p>There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5째C to 37째C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.

                <h3><strong>2. Taking a hot bath kills the new coronavirus disease</strong></h3>
                    <p>Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5째C to 37째C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.

                <h3><strong>3. The new Coronavirus can be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting COVID-19 cases.</strong></h3>
                    <p>Eventhough the new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or upto several days(depending on the type of surface),it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on the surface after being moved,travelled,and exposed to different conditions and temperatures.If you think a surface may be contaminated,use a disinfectant to clean it. After cleaning it, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

                    <p>To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

                        However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

                <h3><strong>5. The new coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites.</strong></h3>
                    <p>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.

                <h3><strong>6. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?</strong></h3>
                    <p>No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.

                    <p>Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.

                    <p>No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

                        The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.
                        
                        However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.

                    <p>At present, there is no evidence that companion pets/animals such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new Coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap after contact with pets. This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and animals.

                    <p>No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. 

                        There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.
